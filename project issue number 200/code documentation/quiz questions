Q) What kind of connections exist between units of same pool?
a. inhibitory
b. excitatory
c. neutral

Q) If one unit of a pool gets higher activation, how does that affect the activation of other units in the same pool?
a. increases
b. decreases
c. remains unaffected

Q) net input is dependent on which of the following?
a. weight[i][j] only
b. weight[i][j] and external input only
c. weight[i][j], external input and output

Q) How is the change in activation calculated?
a. Δai = (max - ai)neti - decay(ai - rest) 
b. Δai = (ai - min)neti - decay(ai - rest) 
c. depends on the sign of net input 


Q) If two units have excitatory connection, and one is activated, what is the phenomenon that both display?
a. resonance
b. rich get richer 

Q) Is it possible for a unit to not get activated even on giving external input?
a. No.
b. Yes, because the gamma and decay values may be such that inhibitory power exceeds the external input.
c. Yes, because external input alone is not enough to activate the unit.
  
Q) What is the change "decay" tries to make to the model?
a. bring activation down as much as possible.
b. bring activation up as much as possible.
c. tends to restore the activation of the unit to its resting level.

Q) What is the difference between hidden and visible units in IAC?
a. visible can recieve external input but hidden cannot.
b. visible affects the activation of other units whereas hidden does not.
c. visible is shown to the user whereas hidden is not even shown to the user.

Q) how many phases are involved to make sure activation of the units is synchronous?
a. 3
b. 2
c. 4
  
Q) Which is the special pool in all pool-projection models?
a. bias pool
b. instance pool
c. name pool
  
Q) why is there an actmax and actmin bound on activation? 
a. to control activation in cases when estr, decay, gamma have outlying values.
b. to control rapid change in activation
