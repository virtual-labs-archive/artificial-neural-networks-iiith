ANN Parallel and distributed processing I: Interactive activation and Competition model Project Documentation

Introduction

This document captures the technical details related to the ANN Parallel and distributed processing I: Interactive activation and Competition model experiment development.

Project

**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name :** Artificial Neural Networks 

**Experiment Name :** Parallel and distributed processing I: Interactive activation and Competition model

An interactive activation and competition network (hereafter, IAC network) consists of a collection of processing units organized into some number of competitive pools. There are excitatory connections among units in different pools and inhibitory connections among units within the same pool. The excitatory connections between pools are generally bidirectional, thereby making the processing interactive in the sense that processing in each pool both influences and is influenced by processing in other pools. Within a pool, the inhibitory connections are usually assumed to run from each unit in the pool to every other unit in the pool. This implements a kind of competition among the units such that the unit or units in the pool that receive the strongest activation tend to drive down the activation of the other units. 

Purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Parallel and distributed processing I: Interactive activation and Competition model** experiment simulation from **Java applet** to **Javascript**.

Process Followed to convert the experiment

1.  Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation
2.  Understanding the experiment concept
3.  Re-implement the same in javascript

Value Added by our Project

1.  It would be beneficial for engineering students
2.  Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of design layout.

Risks and Challenges:

Understanding interactive activation and competition mocdels from a research paper and understanding the math behind it. Figuring out implementation of the simulator and deciding what to display to the user and what to not display to the user.

Issues :

None known as of now.
