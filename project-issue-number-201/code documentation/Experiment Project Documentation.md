Project

**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name :** Artificial Neural Networks 

**Experiment Name :** Parallel and distributed processing 2: Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network model

The above idea of constraint satisfaction can be captured in a PDP model consisting of several units and connections among the units. In this model the units represent hypotheses and the connections represent the knowledge in the form of constraints between any two hypotheses. It is obvious that the knowledge cannot be precise and hence the representation of the knowledge in the form of constraints may not also be precise. So the solution being sought is to satisfy simultaneously as many constraints as possible. Note that the constraints usually are weak constraints, and hence all of them need not be satisfied fully as in the normal constrained optimization problems. The degree of satisfaction is evaluated using a goodness-of-fit function, defined in terms of the output values of the units as well as the weights on the connections between units. 

Purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Parallel and distributed processing 2: Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network model** experiment simulation from **Java applet** to **Javascript**.

Value Added by our Project

1.  It would be beneficial for engineering students
2.  Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network.

Risks and Challenges:

Understanding Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network models from a research paper and understanding the math behind it. The detailing on the diagrams was very important as small hinton diagrams are supposed to give all the idea regarding the descriptors.

Issues :

None known as of now.
