Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network PROCEDURE DOCUMENTATION

Introduction:

<span id="anchor"></span>This document captures the instructions to run the simulation.

Instructions:

1. Select a region from the dropdown menu. 

2. Change the number of data points if you wish to(range: 1-2000) (only integer). 

3. Change the number of total iterations if you wish to(range: 100-3000) (only integer).

4. Change the iteration step size if you wish to(range: 1-500) (only integer).

5. Change the initial sigma value if you wish to(range: 0.1-1.9).

6. Change the initial learning rate if you wish to(range: 0.001-1).

7. Change the dimensions (NxN) if you wish to(range: 3-11) (only integer).

8. click on "generate graphs" to generate the graphs for weights(on the left) and for data(on the right).

9. Click on next iteration to perform the number of iterations as specified in the "Iteration Step Size" variable by you.

10. Observe how the number of iterations, learning rate and sigma value have changed after iterations begin.

11. Observe the change in the shape of the weights distribution. This is feature mapping.

12. you may change the iteration step size if you wish to speed up the iterations or slower it down.

13. Click on next iteration after changing iteration step size.

14. Click on "Reset" to start with another set of random data and weights.

15. Tweak the variables and observe the changes that come up.
