ANN Competitive Learning Neural Network model Project Documentation

Introduction

This document captures the technical details related to the ANN Competitive Learning Neural Network model experiment development.

Project

**Domain Name :** Computer Science & Engineering

**Lab Name :** Artificial Neural Networks 

**Experiment Name :** Competitive Learning Neural Network model

The basic architecture of a competitive learning system is a common one. It consists of a set of hierarchically layered units in which each layer connects, via excitatory connections, with the layer immediately above it, and has inhibitory connections to units in its own layer. In the most general case, each unit in a layer receives an input from each unit in the layer immediately below it and projects to each unit in the layer immediately above it. Moreover, within a layer, the units are broken into a set of inhibitory clusters in which all elements within a cluster inhibit all other elements in the cluster. Thus the elements within a cluster at one level compete with one another to respond to the pattern appearing on the layer below. The more strongly any particular unit responds to an incoming stimulus, the more it shuts down the other members of its cluster. 

Purpose of the project:

The purpose of the project is to convert the **Parallel and distributed processing 2: Competitive Learning Neural Network model** experiment simulation from **Java applet** to **Javascript**.

Value Added by our Project

1.  It would be beneficial for engineering students
2.  Highly beneficial for tier 2 and tier 3 college students who can use this to learn and understand the concept of Constraint Satisfaction Neural Network.

Risks and Challenges:

Understanding Competitive Learning Neural Network models from a research paper and understanding the math behind it. It was a challenge to keep the code efficient as it is not easy for so many connections to render with such speed. It is also unlike MATLAB where matrix operations are performed at terrific speed due to parallel processing.

Issues :

None known as of now.
